## BLADE: I Match Your Trick

Blade is an aggressive inline skating game where players take turns to set a trick which their opponent(s) must match. It's basically H.O.R.S.E on inline skates.

I'm building this game after a 7 year hiatus from inline skating as a way to teach myself all the grinds I can't do anymore ðŸ˜‚. The code is fully open source and I'd love any help/feedback. My aim is simply to try to create a quality game/app for skaters during the current (2020) renascence the sport is enjoying.

### Todo:

- [ ] Images, this is the big one and I need help with it. If anyone has high quality images they would be cool with me using I would love to hear from you info@flatsteve.com. I'd attribute every photographer and link to any portfolio sites.
- [ ] More tricks and better logic around trick combinations. Skating tricks are kinda hard to program around as trick names (whilst generally following established naming rules) are pretty arbitrary.
- [ ] A better single player element - maybe a high score leader-board or something.

### Credits

When researching this project I took inspiration for how tricks are aliased from atleastimtrying's Roll Sucka.

### Project structure

If people actually likes this app, I would like to convert it to a native mobile app using React Native - hence this monorepo structure.
