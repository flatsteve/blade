      <p>
        BLADE is an aggressive inline skating game where players take turns to
        set a trick which their opponent(s) must match.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player fails to set the trick, the game progresses to the next
        player. Once a trick is set, all other players must attempt to land it
        or they get a letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a player has missed five set tricks, and spelt out the word BLADE,
        they are out.
      </p>

      <p>
